    "The U.S. LEI continued to increase in July. However, with the exception of the money supply and interest rate components, other leading indicators show greater weakness � consistent with increasing concerns about the health of the economic expansion. Despite rising volatility, the leading indicators still suggest economic activity should be slowly expanding through the end of the year.",
    "The composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading, coincident, and lagging economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading, coincident, or lagging indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component � primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.",

Beryllium in newer generation mammography equipment enables a lower radiation dose scan with significantly finer tumor resolution, enabling breast cancer detection at its early, most treatable stages.",

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Italian family of Borgias used arsenic as their favorite poison for political assassinations.

    String text = "This article provides a review of the literature on clinical correlates of awareness in dementia. Most inconsistencies were found with regard to an association between depression and higher levels of awareness. Dysthymia, but not major depression, is probably related to higher levels of awareness. Anxiety also appears to be related to higher levels of awareness. Apathy and psychosis are frequently present in patients with less awareness, and may share common neuropathological substrates with awareness. Furthermore, unawareness seems to be related to difficulties in daily life functioning, increased caregiver burden, and deterioration in global dementia severity. Factors that may be of influence on the inconclusive data are discussed, as are future directions of research.";
